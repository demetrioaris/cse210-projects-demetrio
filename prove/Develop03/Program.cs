        I create 5 classes
        for the verse,  scripture and  for the reference,
        and also create a class with name setting to display the list of option
        and the class word where has the funtion to hide

        For the Exceeding Requirements
        I did a menu, where a display a list of 3 option
        1) to show how many scripture is save, and start the program to hide words
        2) to introduce a new scripture but in this case, because I am late, I will do later
        3) to exit the program

        How this program work??
        so how this work, when the user choose to start the program, 
        this going to display the list of current scriptures, just the reference
        and ask the user to choose one, then with the choose scripture is display,
        then ask the user to introduce a amount of words to hide, between 1 to 10
        then the words start to hide until all words has replaced when the user press enter
        finaly ask the user to introduce q to quit
        return to start menu, and the user can do the process with other scripture again or stop the program
